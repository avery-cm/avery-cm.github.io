		<div class = "bio">An international sweetheart, Eggs can be found in your favorite dessert or baked goods. But don’t be fooled by her sweet tastes, Eggs also has a savory side.  Catch her in your next brunch entree-- she’s a guaranteed headliner. <br> &#x26A1; <b>Warning:</b> most severe of all the allergies &#x26A1; </br></div>
		<div class = "bio">Something smells fishy... must be Seafood! He’s the prankster of the group and can take many forms, including <b>sushi, lobster, oysters,  salmon, and many more</b>. A good rule of thumb: if it comes from the ocean (and it’s not seaweed), it’s a no-go. <br>&#x26A1; <b>Warning:</b> very severe allergy &#x26A1; </br></div>
		<div class = "bio">With veganism and healthy eating blowing up in the Bay Area, most people are nuts about Nuts! Included in Avery’s Allergies are most <b>tree nuts (cashews, almonds, pecans, walnuts, pistachios, etc)</b> but don’t include peanuts (which are a legume, not a nut).  <br> 🥜  Peanuts, pine nuts, coconuts, and macadamia nuts are <b>not</b> included as an allergy, which means they’re fine for Avery to eat!</br></div>
		<div class = "bio">Yeah, we’re not really sure if he’s a real Allergy, or just an Intolerance. He was one of the last Allergies  to emerge, and usually shows himself in undercooked beef, and is especially bad in <b>steak and burgers.</b> <br>&#x1F404; Assess on a case by case basis, but usually it's no.</br></div>
		<div class = "bio">It’s unclear whether the Banana is an Allergy or just a really intense dislike, but either way, he’s part of the group to stay. <br></br> </div>
		<div class = "bio">Kiwi is oh-so-sweet, but she packs a real allergic punch, along with her Chinese cousin, Dragonfruit. Fun fact: last consumed in 2008!<br></br></div>
		<div class = "bio">The only human in the group. Has way too many Allergies and thought she'd have some fun with them for once.<br></br></div>
